                    <p class="bio"> Hello everyone! My name is Josh and welcome to my portfolio website. This is my first serious attempt at learning how to code and am excited for what the future brings! So a little about myself, I am currently tweny-five years old and am working at Costco Wholesale. I've been employed there for almost eight years now and have felt stuck so decided to enroll in this coding bootcamp in order to make a career change. In my free time I enjoy gaming or being out in nature and am always up for spontaneous adventures. I've visited several countries in South America and the Carribean, I'm hoping to visit Europe or Asia in the near future.</p>
